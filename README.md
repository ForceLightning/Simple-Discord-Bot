# Simple Discord Bot :D

 A simple silly discord bot to react to your stinky messages!!

## Silly Features :P

- simple regex matching on new messages
- good/bad bot
- reacting when @'d

## Remember to do this!

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python libraries required to run it:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this project, you will need to add the `BOT_TOKEN` to your `.env` file

In case you are unable to find your `BOT_TOKEN`, follow [this guide](https://docs.discordbotstudio.org/setting-up-dbs/finding-your-bot-token)!

## Future Ideas :^)
- Implement profanity word matching with [better-profanity](https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/)
- Issue timeout/warnings
- Log & collect repeated offences from users

### Look at my bot go!
